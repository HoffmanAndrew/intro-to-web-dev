<h1>Erwin Smith</h1>

<div id="scroll-container">
  <div id="scroll-text">
    Everything you thought had meaning<br>
    Every hope dream or moment of happiness<br>
None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the battlefield <br>
None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body <br>
<u>We all die</u><br>
But does that mean our lives are meaningless <br>
Does that mean that there was no point in our being born<br>
Would you say that of our slain comrades<br>
What about their lives <br>
Were they meaningless <br>
<p style="font-size: 60px;">They were not!</p>
Their memory serves as an example to us all<br>
The courageous fallen<br>
The anguished fallen<br>
Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them<br>
And as we ride to certain death we trust our successors to do the same for us <br>
Because my soldiers do not buckle or <br>
yield when faced with the <p style="color: red; font-size: 70px; margin-top: 5px;">cruelty</p> of this world<br>
My soldiers push forward!<br>
My soldiers scream out!<br>
My soldiers
<p style="color: red; font-size: 80px; margin-top: 5px;">Rage!</p>
