    <div class="col"><p>This is some filler text that I didnt know what to write.
      So here are just some words for no reason at all. I need a lot of filler text so I'm not sure what to put here but I don't want to do Lorem Ipsum.
    So I'm just going to type some stuff out. Fun fact if you do acutally read this is that I was run over by a skidsteer when I was one.
    I was in a body cast for a while. Luckly I'm all good with nothing but a few scars. Another fun fact is that I use to play guitar in a band.
    I was the rhythm guitar player. I did that for about three years. </p> </div>
      <div class="col"> <p>By the way two plus two equals four.
      But it can sometimes equal five if you are really good at math.</p></div>
