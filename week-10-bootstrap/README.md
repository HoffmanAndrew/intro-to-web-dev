# Week 3: Layout

Modify `index.html` and `styles.css` to create a website for a business.

The business can be real, imaginary, or aspirational. Get creative! Here are
some ideas:

- Your favorite local business
- A bookstore that only sells your favorite books
- A photography studio that specializes in pictures of your pet

Your website should contain at least the following:

- At least 1 element with `display: grid` containing at least two children
- At least 1 element with a grid property (other than `display:grid`)
- At least 1 element with `display: flex` containing at least two children
- At least 1 element with a flex property (other than `display:flex`)
- At least 1 style that displays differently based on the width of the screen

Exactly what layout you create is up to you. You might use grid layout to show
a grid of thumbnail images, or you might use flexbox to create a navigation
bar. Whatever you think your business webpage needs is great, as long as you
satisfy the above requirements.

If it helps, feel free to add other HTML files with different layouts. For
example, you might have a separate "about" page. Or feel free to use fake links
in your navigation.
